# traffic-congestion-tweets-and-drift
The "Traffic Congestion Tweets+Drifts" project represents a groundbreaking effort to transform the
analysis of traffic-related information. The project's core objective is to create a sophisticated system
capable of classifying and clustering tweets associated with traffic congestion. The project unfolds
through the meticulous collection and labeling of a substantial dataset of traffic-related tweets,
harnessed through the Twitter Search API. The primary aim is to intelligently categorize tweets into
three distinct classes: Non-Traffic, Traffic Incident, and Traffic Conditions and Information (TCI).
What sets this project apart is its comprehensive approach, integrating both supervised and
unsupervised learning techniques to enhance classification accuracy and offer a comprehensive
perspective on traffic patterns.
The project entails multifaceted requirements, encompassing diverse tasks such as amassing a dataset
of at least 15,000 labeled traffic-related tweets and crafting advanced feature extraction methods to
accurately represent the nuanced nature of tweet data. These extracted features serve as crucial inputs
for subsequent classification and clustering processes. In the classification realm, the project employs
supervised learning techniques to effectively detect known traffic incidents. Additionally, a
pioneering unsupervised clustering approach is devised to identify and classify Traffic Conditions and
Information (TCI)-related tweets, further enriching the depth of analysis.
The overarching purpose of this project is to provide an invaluable tool for real-time analysis of
tweets relating to traffic congestion. The system's adeptness in promptly identifying incidents,
predicting congestion patterns, and furnishing a holistic understanding of traffic conditions bears
immense potential for traffic management, emergency response, and public awareness initiatives.
